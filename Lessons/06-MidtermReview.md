## [**30m**] ✓ Quiz Corrections

Choose a partner or group of 3 to work with on this activity.

Together with your group, find the answers to all quiz questions that you earned <100% on. You may use any online resource, e.g. documentation, your own code/tutorials, etc. **_Make sure everyone in your group understands each answer before you move on._**

You will earn 50% of the points in addition to your original score; so, if you originally earned a 60% and score a 90% on the retake, your new score will be 75%.

Continue working on your `v1` solution for the `makewiki` project.
