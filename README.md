## Course Description

In this course, students will learn to develop and release standardized server-side applications that include authorized and authenticated users. Techniques include favoring convention over configuration, following a strict RESTful MVC architecture, and emphasizing the role of automated testing.

This course begins by fostering familiarity with framework features, then rapidly moves into building server-side web applications and APIs. Deliverables include at least two completed and deployed applications.

## Prerequisites

* [BEW 1.1](https://make.sc/bew1-1)

## Learning Outcomes

Students by the end of the course will be able to...

1. Compare and contrast configuration and convention based frameworks in backend web development.
1. Design, implement, and deploy multiple web applications via an opinionated web framework.
1. Build SQL-based Object Relationships Manager (ORM) patterns and queries.
1. Practice automated testing paradigms.
